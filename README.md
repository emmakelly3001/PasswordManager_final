This application provides a user-friendly interface for account management.
Users can log in with their existing username and password or create a new account by entering a username and password.
Users are prompted to re-enter the password for verification in the sign-up process for verification purposes.
During account creation, the application ensures security by hashing the password for confidentiality. 
The hashed password is then added to the MYSQL database.
The application provides clear messages for successful account creation, database connection, existing account login, or unsuccessful login attempts.
It prioritizes a user-friendly experience while maintaining robust security measures.
